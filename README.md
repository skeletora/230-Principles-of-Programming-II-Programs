Homework 1 | I was to import files from the professor's directory and then modify them.  The goal of this program was to familiarize us with importing files on Linux and the professor's submission process. | [Homework 1, Capture the File](http://mirkwood.cs.edinboro.edu/~bennett/class/csci230/spring2018/index.html)
