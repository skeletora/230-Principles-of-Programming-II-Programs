# 230-Principles-of-Programming-II-Programs
These are all of the programs that I wrote for my Principles of Programming II class.

Program | Description | Link to Specifications
------- | ----------- | ----------------------
Homework 1 | I was to import files from the professor's directory and then modify them.  The goal of this program was to familiarize us with importing files on Linux and the professor's submission process. | [Homework 1, Capture the File](http://mirkwood.cs.edinboro.edu/~bennett/class/csci230/spring2018/index.html)
Homework 2 | I was to write a program that could classify strings as palindromes.  The goal of this program was to strengthen our ability to manipulate strings | [Homework 2, Notlob?](http://mirkwood.cs.edinboro.edu/~bennett/class/csci230/spring2018/index.html)
Homework 3 | I was to write a program that used both recursive and non-recursive methods of calculating Fibonnaci numbers.  The goal of this program was to teach us about recursion and how inefficient it can be. | [Homework 3, Homework 3, Homework 3,...](http://mirkwood.cs.edinboro.edu/~bennett/class/csci230/spring2018/index.html)
Homework 4 | I was to write an integer, multi-base calculator that could perform basic arithmetic on numbers in any base between 2 and 36.  The goal of this program was to demonstrate our knowledge of arrays | [Homework 4, Multi-base Calculator](http://mirkwood.cs.edinboro.edu/~bennett/class/csci230/spring2018/index.html)
Homework 5 | I was to write two programs that handled palindromes.  As a part of this program, I had to use pieces of code provided by the professor.  The goal of this program was to strengthen our knowledge of arrays as well as familiarize us with using multiple files in a program | [Homework 5: "Pal fun nuf lap?"](http://mirkwood.cs.edinboro.edu/~bennett/class/csci230/spring2018/index.html)
